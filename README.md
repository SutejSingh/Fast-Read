## Function
Fast read helps you reduce the time it takes to read long articles. It can help you become 30-45% faster at reading. It can help readers and can easily integrate into a pre-existing suite of reading assistance software like Microsoft's Immersive Reader.

## Inspiration
Everybody doesn't like reading the long reading assignments for some subjects. For eg, I can't take reading a 60-page article for history. I have always wanted to develop a tool that would help me read and understand the articles faster so that I could invest my time in doing things that I enjoy. Therefore, building that tool was a natural choice.

## How I built it
I built it using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. JavaScript handles all the text functions in the back while HTML and CSS please your eyes.

## Challenges I ran into
The hardest part was definitely JavaScript. Figuring out how to manage the text data and make it appear in fixed intervals on the screen, depending on the WPM, took a lot of time for me. Also centering a div can sometimes take way longer than one would assume.

## Accomplishments that I am proud of
I am proud that I was able to build what I set out to build. Though, I wish I had enough time to implement a few features I had in mind.

## What I learned
It is better when you have a team to work with. I felt handicapped without one. Also, some tasks which may seem easy can end up taking a lot more time than planned.

## What's next for Fast Read
- [ ] Ability to highlight the text where you left off
- [ ]  Having a slider to adjust WPM while reading
- [ ] Drop and read PDF, Word, and Google Docs file
- [ ] UI improvement
- [ ] Integrate a suite of other reading assistance softwares
