# Fast-Read
## Function
Fast read helps you reduce the time it takes to read long articles. It can help you become 30-45% faster at reading.

## Inspiration
I really don't like reading the long history reading assignments at all. I have always wanted to develop a tool that would help me read and understand the articles faster so that I could invest my time in doing things that I enjoy. So building that tool was a natural choice.

## How I built it
I built it using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. JavaScript handles all the text functions in the back while HTML and CSS please your eyes.

## Challenges I ran into
The hardest part was definitely JavaScript. Figuring out how to manage the text data and make it appear in fixed intervals on the screen took a lot of time for me. Also centering a div can be a huge problem too.

## Accomplishments that I am proud of
I am proud that I was able to build what I aimed to build. Though, I wish I had enough time to implement a few features I had in mind.

## What I learned
Centering a div can get hard sometimes ðŸ˜‚. Also that it is better when you have a team to work with. I felt handicapped without one. 

## What's next for Fast Read
- [ ] Ability to highlight the text where you left off
- [ ]  Having a slider to adjust WPM while reading
- [ ] Drop and read PDF, Word and Google Docs file
- [ ] UI improvement
